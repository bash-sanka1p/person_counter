# The Idea
In our college and my previous school every day after lunch the peon used to visit every class and count the number of students inside the class for the school records. So looking at this my friend came up with a thought to make a device for the same. In the same semester, we got or mini-project based on IoT. So we thought it was a good time to build it. 
At first, we thought of using a face detaction model and deploying it to Arduino, so that it could count the number of people and as well as take the attendance of the students. But…… there were two problems with that. None of us knew TinyML so after building the model we might have to spend time learning TinyML another is that the face detection model counts an image too, so anyone could have fooled the system by just showing the picture of a person.
